    <p>
        There is no denying that biryani is one of the most popular dishes in India. <br>
        And with good reason! This rice and meat dish is absolutely delicious. <br>
        It was first introduced in India, when Mughals invaded the region, and the Arabs <br>
        introduced it to some regions of Southern India. <br>
        When it comes to biryani, there are various schools of thought, from diffrent regions. <br>
        But the most popular ones are the Lucknowi style and the Hyderabadi style. <br>
        While both are delicious in their own right, there are some key differences that set them apart. <br>
